          A journal to document the story and journey of the backbone of
          India&rsquo;s economy &ndash; The Industrialists.
        </p>
        <p>
          There might be eight-hundred-twelve interviews with Sam Altman or some
          SaaS founder, but we can rarely find a really good interview with
          someone from the heavy industries. Unlike the startup world, heavy
          industry does not receive much attention, and nobody interviews
          industrialists. These individuals hold vast amounts of heuristics and
          knowledge about building successful businesses, understanding how
          things work, and providing specific context about India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing you are reading this on is a product of a factory. The thing
          you are sitting on, again, is a product of a factory.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we want to become a self-sustaining industrial state like America,
          China, or Germany, then we need to accelerate. We need more smart
          people pursuing this. We need to inspire the new generation to get
          into manufacturing. And to do that we need to show them this side of the world, for sports and fantasy fiction will take you no far.
        </p><p>
          We plan to release interviews with industrialists and their factory
          tours and journal them.
        </p>
